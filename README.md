# What is Determined Path ?

"Determined Path" is a video game that depicts the daily life of Andi, a bus driver who works to meet his daily needs. 
The game highlights the dynamic relationship between bus drivers and passengers, emphasizing their mutual dependence. 
To serve the community effectively, buses require drivers who understand road ethics and possess the quick decision-making skills necessary for safety. 
Conversely, bus drivers choose this profession to earn a livelihood, making the relationship between drivers and passengers one of mutual necessity. 
In "Determined Path," players take on the role of the driver, maneuvering the bus, managing the bus environment, and ensuring safe transport of passengers. 
The game was envisioned to teach the players the importance of safety on the road, obeying traffic laws, and ensuring everyone on the road is having a great time.


# Target Audience

Casual players who want to use their free time to relax and unwind without having to think too much, while still maintaining the realistic aspects of being a public bus driver.

3D visual experiences to depict an immersive world from the perspective of a bus driver. To meet this goal, Determined Path will be designed for PC players.
